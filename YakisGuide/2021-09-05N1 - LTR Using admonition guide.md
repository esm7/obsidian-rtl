# Multi language-directions in the same note 

## Abstract
Almost every obsidian user who writes in RTL language(like Hebrew and Arabic) aware of this problem: you want to write the note in your Right To Left language using the outstanding plug-in called "RTL Support". Yet, when you want to change the page direction, it affected the entire note, even you've some parts in the document that you want them to display in LTR direction(like code, some English quote etc. ).
The "RTL Support" plug-in changes the direction in the `<Body>` section, while this workaround will takes care of the option of changing the direction in the `<div>` level.

**Then click on "Add New"**

**In the next window insert the details of the new admonition:**
* Admonition Type: the name of this admonition (later you'll use this name).

**Then click the "âœ”" symbol.**

## Step 3: Customize the new Admonition's CSS
**Open the directory of your Obsidian's vault.**
**Open the file** (using some text editor):  
<Your_Obsidian_Path>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-admonition/styles.css
add the code:
```css
.admonition-<your Admonition Type>{
	direction:ltr;
}
```
**In my case it'll be:**

**Then save and restart your Obsidian**

## Step 4: Use the customized Admonition
**In your none Insert a Code Block with the format:**
````
```ad-<Admonition Type>
title: <your_title>

your content..
```
````

**In my case :**
`````
````ad-code
